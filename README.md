# T-wave Alternans Estimator
## Spectral Analysis of T-wave Alternans (Kscore)

The Kscore method relies on point-by-point spectral analysis of the T-wave magnitude at a frequency of 0.5 cycle per beat. Initially, each T-wave is measured at specific time form the QRS complex. Then, the fluctuations on the magnitude of each sample in T-wave vector is measured using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), generating a power spectrum for each point in the the T-wave. Finally, the power spectrum are aggregated and the final markers calculated using the two equation mention below:

Where,  $P$ corresponded to the accumulated amplitude of the power spectrum, usually at a $f = 0.5Hz$. $P_{N}$ and $\sigma_{P_{N}}$ corresponds respectively to the mean and standard deviation of the power spectrum at the noise band, usually set at $f=[0.43:0.49]Hz$. The K\textsubscript{score} measures the statistical significance of the alternans in relation to the noise levels while K\textsubscript{TWAM} is a direct measure of the TWA magnitude. A visual representation of the algorithm is shown in the figure below.
